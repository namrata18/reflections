How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff between two versions of file help me know the typo or the code i added which could be the reason of the bug in the program .

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    you get to know your mistakes and analyse them.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Since it is a call of judgment, it might be possible that the changes you commit are too big or too small.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because files we save in git are generally interdependent while this is not the case with Google Docs.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log is used to track the differences made in the files and git diff is used to know the difference between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Even if I made some changes I can move back to the previous version using git checkout reducing the risk of getting lost in the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
